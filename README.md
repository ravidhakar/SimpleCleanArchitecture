# Android Simple Clean Architecture
This is very simple android clean architecture implementation example  


Android Clean Architecture is a software architecture pattern that aims to separate the concerns of an application into independent layers, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable. Here is a step-by-step guide to implementing Clean Architecture in an Android app:

Define the layers: Start by defining the layers of the application. The three main layers are:
Presentation layer: This layer contains the UI and user interactions.
Domain layer: This layer contains the business logic and use cases.
Data layer: This layer contains the data sources and repositories.
Implement the Presentation layer: Implement the UI using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, which separates the UI logic from the business logic. Create a ViewModel for each screen and use LiveData to observe changes in data.

Implement the Domain layer: Create use cases for each feature of the app. Use cases should be independent of the UI and data sources, and should take input from and return output to the Presentation layer. Use interfaces to define the use cases and implement them in the Data layer.

Implement the Data layer: Create data sources for each type of data required by the app, such as network, local storage, or cache. Use interfaces to define the data sources and implement them in the repositories. Repositories are responsible for getting data from the data sources and returning it to the Domain layer.

Connect the layers: Use dependency injection to connect the layers. Use Dagger or Hilt to provide instances of the interfaces defined in the Domain and Data layers to the Presentation layer.

Test the layers: Write unit tests for the use cases in the Domain layer, and integration tests for the Presentation and Data layers. Use Mockito to mock the interfaces and simulate different scenarios.

Implement other patterns and practices: Use other patterns and practices such as SOLID principles, Repository pattern, and Separation of Concerns to make the code more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

By implementing Clean Architecture, you can build a flexible and scalable Android app that is easy to maintain and test.
